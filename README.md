# Music-Webscraper
Music webscraper coded in Python2.7 for YouTube (soon to be other media such as SoundCloud, Spoitfy, and so on). Make sure to install the modules and you should be good! Enjoy.
# Notes
Make sure when you install the modules, after imageio installs, you install this:
imageio.plugins.ffmpeg.download()
